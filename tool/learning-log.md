* While i was trying to learn more about my topic i was wondering how am i really going to make it into a kearnign game.
So i searched for some games that is fun and educational and here is what i got
Games:
- Mario Bros
- flappy bird

These were some of the idea of what i had to help little kids learn their subrtaction and addition

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%253DhgReGsh5xVU%2526t%253D33s (flappy bird)

Details of the two games

Mario Bros:
- there will be 4 sprites
    - Mario (Main player - 5 lives)
    - Bowser (Addition + Subtraction - 20 questions)
    - Bowser JR (Subtraction - 15 questions)
    - Ludwig Von Koopa(Addition 15 questions)
- Mario has to beat all 15 questions for Ludwig Von Koopa(Addition) and Bowser JR(subtraction)
- once they beat both of them they can go againts Bowser(Addition + Subtration)
- Each question is timed and if not answered on time then they lose 1 life
- once they lose all their lives it would say "Sorry, Game Over" and "High Score: ###" Based of the amount of question gotten correct in the character
- if they have won both mini bosses the game would say "Congradulation now you can go againts the final boss"
- if they lose againts the final boss(Bowser) then they would have to restart the whole game again to continue practicing


Flappy Bird:
- make the sprite have 3 lives
- they sprite has to choose the correct answer based on the question
- once they have the answer they go up or down which is option 1 or 2
- if wrong it will say "Sorry wrong answer"
- if correct it will say " your are correct"
- if they lose all 3 lives the games will say "Game over" and " high score: ###"
- Each question will be timed and once time is over and their is no answer then they lose 1 life
