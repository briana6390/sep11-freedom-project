At the beginning of the week I had though of adding background music to my game, but i dont know whether or not to make my own background music or start looking for one. Another idea that i had was to work with Marhus since he is doing his Project on music, and ask him if we can work together ot make a beat. But as of this week i am only trying ot look of their is a code that would let me add any type of music to my game. As of this week i was able to find out about a code hich answered my answer. Kaboom was able to solve my question and the code I had to use was loadMusic. this code would let add my music file as a background music. While I was loooking more inthi thus code i was able to also find a code that would let me add sound to my sprite. loadSound would let me eadd a sound that i would like to put and i think that i will start putting two sounds that if they get a question correct then they will get a cheer fro a crowd but if they the question erong they will get Boo from a crowd
